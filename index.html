                <p class="text-justify lead">
                    The recent advances in unravelling the secrets of human conditions and diseases have encouraged new
                    paradigms for their prevention, diagnosis and treatment. As the information is increasing at
                    unprecedented rate, it directly impacts the design and future development of information and data
                    management pipelines; thus, new ways of processing data, information and knowledge in health care
                    environments are strongly needed.<br>
                    The proposed workshop aims at being, both, a starting meeting point for Information Systems,
                    Conceptual Modeling, and Data Management researchers working on health care and life science
                    problems, and an opportunity to share, discuss and find new approaches to improve promising fields,
                    with a special focus on Genomic Data Management - how to use the information from the genome to
                    better understand biological and clinical features - and Precision Medicine - giving to each patient
                    an individualized treatment by understanding the peculiar aspects of the disease.<br>
                    From the precise ontological characterization of the components involved in complex biological
                    systems, to the modeling of the operational processes and decision support methods used in the
                    diagnosis and prevention of disease, the joined research communities of Information Systems,
                    Conceptual Modeling, and Data Management have an important role to play; they must help in providing
                    feasible solutions for a high-quality and efficient health care.</p>

                    Anna Bernasconi is currently completing her PhD research at Politecnico di Milano, within the “Data-driven Genomic Computing” ERC Awarded project (2016-2021), under the supervision of Professor Stefano Ceri. In 2015 she obtained a Master of Science in Computer Engineering from Politecnico di Milano and a Master of Science in Computer Science from University of Illinois at Chicago with a thesis on Formal Methods. Her research is on bioinformatics data and metadata integration methodologies to support complex biological query answering. Main expertise areas include conceptual data design, data integration, data cleaning, semantic web, data analysis; she is passionate about models and methods formalization. Her PhD thesis is focused on building a repository of genomic datasets, using a data integration pipeline that collects input from many open data sources; integration is solved on the schema level (driven by a proposed Conceptual Model) and on the value level (with semantical enrichment using specialized ontologies). The repository is made available through a Web interface for the biomedical research community, fueling biological knowledge discovery. She took part in the organization of GeCo Workshop on “Challenges in Data-Driven Genomic Computing” (March 2019), in Como, Italy. She gave seminars about metadata management and integration for Genomics at IBM Research Lab – Zurich, ETH University – Zurich, EPFL – Lausanne (Switzerland), and at the GeCo Workshop (Como, Italy). She currently collaborates with research groups in Roma Tre University – Italy (standardization and integration of genomics data from The Cancer Genome Altas Program) and Università Magna Graecia, Catanzaro – Italy (querying, and integrating public and private datasets).
